### Five-number summary

The **five-number summary** consists of five values:  minimum, first quantile, second quantile, third quantile, and maximum.  The quantiles are calculated as:

- first quantile ($Q_1$): the median of the first half of the sorted data
- third quantile ($Q_3$): the median of the second half of the sorted data

> First quantile: 25^th^ percentile.
Second quantile: 50^th^ percentile.
Third quantile: 75^th^ percentile.

The _interquartile range_ or `IQR` is defined as $Q_3 - Q_1$ and is a measure of how spread out the middle 50% of values is.
